## Hi, I'm Iwo ! 

Career-focused, ambitious, creative Junior Developer and UI/UX enthusiast.
Soon completing a full-time, one-year course in Full Stack development.
I can say with certainty that coding has grown into a full-blown passion for me.
I have found the use of JavaScript in conjunction with frameworks like React interesting and one that grows the more I use it.
Now I'm looking forward to growing my skill set in a professional environment while producing work that has an impact.



 **​Happy to work with:** 
- HTML
- CSS
- SASS 
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- React
- Github
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
